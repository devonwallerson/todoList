# This project makes a simple to-do list web application, which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thank you for viewing my
# project!

# Using HTML and CSS, I designed a simple web interface that allows users to input a list name and their actual to-do
# list. 

# Then, using JavaScript, I allowed users to add, check, and rmeove items from the lists that are locally saved on the machine

# I will improve this project by adding it to my future project, where there will be a web app that has multiple tools for college students, including a to-do List function.
